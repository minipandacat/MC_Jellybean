Created a mortage calculator in Android Studio with Java

This project was inspired by and created exclusively for academic purposes; we were required to implement a mortgage calculator via an app (PC or mobile) or web-app. The requirements were as follows: amortization table, loan calculator, impact of additional payments (monthly and yearly) and ability to compare at least two different mortgage scenarios. We were allowed to include additional features as we saw fit.
